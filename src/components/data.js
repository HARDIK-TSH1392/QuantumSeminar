        title: "Fiber based QKD - Practical aspects & challenges",
        bio: "The talk will essentially cover details of the fiber based Quantum Key Distribution and elaborate upon practical aspects and challenges in it's implementation as well as deployment. Atul Kumar Gupta has more than 30 Years of experience in the design and development of Optical Communication based products. He has worked on design of Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) based systems, Fiber Access System, Optical Amplifiers, Giga-bit capable Passive Optical Network (GPON), Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) equipment, Quantum key Distribution (QKD) etc."

        title: "Quantum cryptography beyond quantum key distribution",
        bio: "The talk will be on how quantum cryptography is different from the traditional classical cryptography and what leads to security in the quantum world? Subsequently, he will discuss some tricks that can help us to construct protocols for cryptographic tasks other than quantum key distribution. Specifically, he will discuss protocols for quantum secure direct communication, quantum dialogue, quantum conference, etc. He will also show that the unconditional security of the quantum world can be used to design various schemes for secure multiparty computation tasks like quantum e-commerce, quantum sealed bid auction, quantum voting. Finally, he will briefly discuss how to hack so called unhackable schemes of secure quantum communication and computation."

        work: "PRL, Ahmedabad",
        title: "Satellite-based Quantum Communication: Challenges",
        bio: "Due to inherent loses in optical fibres they can not be used for long distance quantum communication, since quantum states used for communication cannot be amplified unlike classical signals. Therefore, to cover distances of hundreds to thousands of kilometres, one needs to go for satellite-based quantum communication. In fact, a practical solution requires integration of satellite-based quantum communication with fibre-based quantum communication. However, road to satellite quantum communication goes through free-space quantum communication. Therefore, we will first discuss some of the free-space quantum communication experiments carried out in our lab giving details of the setup. Later, we will discuss the experiments using satellite quantum communication and the future outlook of the field."

        work: "DRDO, Delhi ",
        title: "Quantum Key Distribution: Implementation Challenges and The Way Ahead",
        bio: "Quantum technologies leverage on quantum physics properties such as superposition, entanglement, to provide disruptive solutions for processing information, exchanging data and interacting with the world. Quantum computing, Quantum communication and Quantum Sensing are the three verticals with the potential of impacting the defence, national security and other sector. Out of these three, the Quantum Communication especially the quantum key distribution (QKD) is the most mature and most ubiquitous applications of quantum technology. He will discuss about the implementation of Distributed Phase Reference based on phase and time-bin encoding QKD Protocols on optical fibre media up to 100 km and the results obtained and lesson learned during field trials will be presented."
